# Earthworm-Robot
Physical realization of an earthworm robot with a force-based feedback control algorithm
# Introduction
Earthworm are very interesting animals but yet not a lot studied in robotics. In com-
parison with other animal-like robots, earthworm robot have seen a small development
and not many applications in real life cases. Their small size and their adaptability could
play a fundamental role in many real-life scenario where humans and traditional robots
struggle to work. If we think for example about inaccessible place like pipes, small holes or
dangerous areas (inaccessible for other robots), earthworm robot could play a fundamental
role. Another interesting application could be for medical examination with non-invasive
approach.
Several works have been carried out by other researcher. We have a great realization by
[1] or a similar example by [2]. Other realization were carried on also by [3] and [4].
In our realization we are focusing more on different aspects: modularity, behaviour with
respect to different situations (hill or slope conditions) and adaptability depending on the
terrain. As we will explain later on, thanks to a force/friction based feedback control
algorithm, the robot is capable of moving effciently in different situations.

This project was carried out from October 2019 to February 2020, during the exchange
period studying at Tohoku University. The laboratory that hosted me and provided the
resources for the robot is the Ishiguro - Kano laboratory, see [5].
